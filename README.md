# GamerBot  
  
Hello okay I've never really made anything with Python before so I thought I'd learn it by making a Discord bot. Although syntax is wack, all languages are close enough to each other conceptually that it was easy to figure out.  
  
Also most of the code is in one file because when I tried putting them in multiple files I kept getting circular dependency errors and I didn't really know how to fix that so whatever. The code is still structured in a way that I can separate out into separate files later on.
