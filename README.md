# GamerBot  
  
Hello okay I've never made anything with Python before so I thought I'd learn it by making a Discord bot. All languages are close enough to each other conceptually so it was easy to figure out. If you see a bunch of stuff in the code that could've been written more efficiently or that isn't standard Python convention, at least you know why now.  
  
Also most of the code is in one file because when I tried putting them in multiple files I kept getting circular dependency errors and I didn't really know nor have the time to learn how to fix that so whatever. The code is still structured in a way that I can separate out into separate files later on.

gamer bot is lovely :)
