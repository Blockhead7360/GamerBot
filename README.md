# GamerBot  

## About the bot
The main idea of GamerBot is to be able to talk to it using normal people sentences and receive varied responses rather than just running commands. You can say hi to it, and you'll receive a response back with your name, provided that you told it your name. You can ask it to remember stuff about you, and then others (or you yourself) can ask it about you. You can even ask it math questions, questions about Northwestern courses or COVID-19 data, or ask it what a word means. It's very smart and can answer all of that without even needing to look it up unlike you (totally 100% legit not clickbait).

## About the code
Hello okay I've never made anything with Python before so I thought I'd learn it by making a Discord bot. All languages are close enough to each other conceptually so it was easy to figure out. If you see a bunch of stuff in the code that could've been written more efficiently or that isn't standard Python convention, at least you know why now.

Also most of the code is in one file because when I tried putting them in multiple files I kept getting circular dependency errors and I didn't really know nor have the time to learn how to fix that so whatever. The code is still structured in a way that I can separate out into separate files later on.
