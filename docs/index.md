# Gamer Bot Help
I bet you're wondering what gamer bot can do. Look at this.

### Overview
Gamer bot can only read messages that contain its name (`gamer bot` by default) in it.

### Greetings
You can say hello/hey/hi/etc to gamer bot, and it'll say hi back. You can also ask it how it is, etc.

### Memory
You can tell gamer bot what your name is and it'll remember that forever. You can then tell it to remember stuff about you, something like `gamer bot remember that i like food`.

You can then ask it what your name is or to tell you about yourself and it'll tell you everything it remembers about you. You can even be specific, asking something like `gamer bot what do i like`.

The fun part is you can ask gamer bot questions about other people. You could be like `gamer bot what's dilan's favorite color` and if it knows it'll tell you. You can also ask it to tell you about someone else.

If you want it to forget something, just be like `gamer bot forget that i like food` or whatever you want it to forget and it'll do as you ask. You can also tell it to forget everything about you and it'll forget everything about you, including your name.

### Mathematics
Gamer bot has a degree in mathematics so you can ask it to evaluate any mathematical expression. Say something like `gamer bot what's 5+5` or `gamer bot do this math: sqrt(25)` and it'll calculate the answer for you.

### Northwestern
Gamer bot has a side job at Northwestern University so it knows about every single Northwestern course, as well as all the COVID-19 data on campus.

Ask it something like `gamer bot tell me about this course: cs 211` or `gamer bot find the description for this course: math 228-1` and it's got you covered with the course description and prereqs. If you remember part of the name rather than the number, you could even be like `gamer bot tell me about this course: cs fundamentals` and it'll search that subject's courses' names for what you want.

If you wanna know whether you're gonna die if you go outside just ask it something like `gamer bot what's covid like on campus` or `gamer bot what are the covid cases like on campus` and it'll tell you.

### Dictionary and Thesaurus
Gamer bot also has a degree in English so you can ask it what any word means. Ask it something like `gamer bot what does gamer mean` and it'll tell you.

It even knows synonyms and antonyms for words, so you could be like `gamer bot what's another word for hello` or `gamer bot what's the opposite of stop` and it'll tell you everything it knows.

### Bye
Let me know if you want to add something to gamer bot and I'll show you how it's set up. If you know some Python and wanna make cool stuff this is fun. Also let me know if you wanna see how your save data looks and I can show you what gamer bot knows about you. This is really fun so I'm gonna add a ton of random stuff over time.
